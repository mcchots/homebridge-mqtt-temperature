          "accessory": "mqtt-temperature",
          "name": "Living Room Temperature",
          "url": "mqtt://localhost",
          "topic": "home/livingroom/temperature/value",
          "batt_topic": "home/livingroom/temperature/battery",
          "charge_topic": "home/livingroom/temperature/charge",
          "batt_low_perc": "33",
          "username": "username",
          "password": "password",
          "maxTemperature": "75",
          "minTemperature": "-25",
          "serial": "HMT-34932B"
        }
      ],

      "platforms": []
    }


---------------------

`maxTemperature` and `minTemperature` allow you to change the default high and low temperatures.
`serial` allows you to change the serial number to a custom value if you need it.
`batt_topic`, `charge_topic` and `bat_low_perc` are for battery powered sensors. `batt_low_perc` overrides the default 20% value. `charge_topic` is for charging state. It requires values of either 0 or 1 for off and on respectively.

All six are optional including `username` and `password` if you don't use MQTT authentication.
